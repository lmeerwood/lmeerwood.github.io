  My name is Leonard Meerwood and I am a Data Engineer. My favorite language is Python, but I have grown quite fond of SQL.

  ## Study

  I started my Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of Queensland in 2014. The next year I
   moved to be closer to family and continued my degree part time through Charles Sturt University via distance education.
   In the middle of 2019 I graduated from my degree with a GPA of 5.52. In my time there I was given the Dean's Award for Academic Excellence
   twice. 

  ## Life Goals
  
  I wish to pursue a job in the computer science field and get some real life working experiences. After awhile I would like to return to the 
   academic life as a professor and help others learn this exciting field.
