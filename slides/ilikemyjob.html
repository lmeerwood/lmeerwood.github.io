                        The data pipeline essentially takes data from produciton systems, cleans it and provides it in a format that can be queried. It is a lot like a water processing plant in your city, when it's working you won't even notice it is there, but it is still
                        extremely important.

                        As stated before this data is what allows the BIAs to provide their services.

                            An example of this is the survey data we retrieve from QILT.
                            <br /> It requires little more than parsing it and adding a couple of fields to it.

                                Some datasets are quite complex. For instance, Ray created a dataset that has nearly 500 lines of code and 10 pages of documentation explaining it.

                            <li>
                                They require lots of upkeep. Made a dataset for Sathish and TM1, he is constantly asking for adjustments
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Not very good at being used outside their intended purpose. For instace, TM1 datasets.

                            <li>
                                You need to know exactly what fields the end user requires.

                            <li>The grain is at what level you want to see the information. For instance, we only care about a students daily movements, not anything finer. In all likelihood the grain is not going to match what you need for analysis</li>
                            <li>Dimensionality is what allows the facts to answer so many different questions, quickly. Want to know the students who are international? You could probably do that with the source data pretty easily. What about the international
                                students who are enrolled in MA1301? Getting a bit slower. What about a count of all international students who enrolled in MA1301 split by year and study period? You've probably just brought the production system to its
                                knees while the data warehouse hasn't broken a sweat.</li>

                            <li>Quantopian was a financial institute in the states that consumed large amounts of data. They were similar to us in the fact that they used Bash scripts for orchestration.</li>

                            <li>Middle of last year I had to handle a massive change from HR where they updated a few of their definitions around the Work Function and Work Profile. Throughout this time I was in contact with them via Teams keeping them updated
                                on the progress. I also kept others in my team up-to-date as the changes effected nearly eveyrone in the team.

                            <li>It is important that code is not only stored, but the history of the code is also kept.</li>
                            <li>We were initially using SVN, but that was clunky and old. Downloading an enitre code repository consisted of download full copies of every branch someone had made
                            </li>
                            <li>Git was an alternative that is used in many companies the world over.
                            </li>
                            <li>It provides better history management, storing only the changes to files rather than the a full copy of the repository.</li>
                            <li>Atlassian offers a service for git called Bitbucket, which integrates nicely with both Confluence and Jira.</li>
                            <li>Git allows you to look at the person responsible for each line of code. This is critical for data governance</li>

                            At the beginning of the year I pushed hard for the move to Git. It had been planned for quite some time, however, projects always kept coming up and blocking the way. Misty had created a Git methodoligies page in Confluence, and keeping those methods
                            in mind I moved all four environments to Git.
